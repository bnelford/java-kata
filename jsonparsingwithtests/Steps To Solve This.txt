Steps I took to solve this:
Learn about JSON data format & standards
Refamiliarize with Eclipse
Download & Install eclipse
Set up project
Research Java JSON libraries, pick one to try out (org.json.simple, org.json, jackson) 
Learn of their objects & methods
Create principle class with main method
Create manual In-memory representation of both the input JSON object and the output JSON object
Changed libraries from org.json.simple to org.json
Create filereader & file writer
Added arguments to main
Created parser to get input file into in-memory object
Modeled change steps
Brainstormed/Discussed algorithms to transform (recursion, brute force, tree map)
****
Chosen Algorithm:
Recursion
***Implement***
Writing
Debugging (Basic, with system.out)
Playing with flawed inputs (Had bad spaces and bad quotes in text)

***Test***
Test with example input
Tried to create larger json object arrays to test with (JSON GENERATOR)

Attempt to run in terminal
Export project as runnable Jar
Zip
